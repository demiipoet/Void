In Progress:
- Learn Github
- Learning how to create and use logs
-- Have ChatGPT show how to save logs to file
--- I asked. Read response.

Left Off:
- Learning how to add timestamps and such to logs

Next:
- Github stuff
- Fix stats so they can't go beyond 999
- Fix MaxHP so it can't go beyond 9,999
- Make max [Level] = 99
- Return [Bat] stats to normal 
- Return [Player] stats to normal 
- Return [Player] ding stats to normal 
- Have ChatGPT look over updated [Battl()] method

Unit Tests To Do:
- [Player.TakeDamage] does not go over [9999]
- [Monster.TakeDamage] does not go over [9999]
- [Player] chooses "Attack": Monster takes correct damage
- [Player] chooses "Defend": Player receives [1] damage
- [Player] [Attack] vs [Monster] [Defense]
- [Player] [Defense] vs [Monster] [Attack]
- [Level] doesn't go past 99 with ding
- [MaxHP] doesn't go past 999 with ding
- [Monster] [Stats] isntances initializes correctly
- [BaseStats.Strength] doesn't go past 999 with ding
- [BaseStats.Defense] doesn't go past 999 with ding

Questions for ChatGPT:
- How to save logs to a file
- Is there a [Random] method that uses an inclusive range?
-- Why use [Next(x, y)] instead of that?
- Re [Player] [if (processedBattleChoice == "A")], should [int playerDamageDealt] be declared above the [if] statement?
- Re [Monster] [if (processedBattleChoice == "D")], should [int reducedDamage] be declared above the [if] statement?
- Should [ExpUp()] be a [do while] loop?
- should [private int ExpThreshold => Level * 10;] have a [getter] and [setter]?
- In general, should variable definitions (e.g., [int]) go outside of loops and their assignments inside the loops?
